            Library Hi Tech (LHT) is an international, double-blind peer-reviewed, SSCI-listed journal that welcomes empirical, conceptual and methodological contributions on any topics relevant to the broad disciplines of information and communication technologies. However, LHT is particularly concerned with information management, technologies, and systems that support libraries and cultural memory, education and the academy, health and medicine, government/public sectors, and non-government organizations (NGOs). LHT covers the IT-enabled creation, curation, representation, communication, storage, retrieval, analysis, and use of records, documents, files, data, learning objects, and other contents. It also acts as a forum for interdisciplinary and emerging topics such as socio-information studies, educational technologies, knowledge management, big data, artificial intelligence, personal information protection, digital literacy, other media and technology innovation topics in their applications to libraries, as well as other education, information, government and NGOs. LHT welcomes research that applies a broad array of approaches and epistemologies, including any mix of qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods, action, participatory, evaluation, design, development or other established methodologies. LHT invites full research and conceptual papers, as well as scholarly viewpoints and review articles (normally between 4,000 to 8,000 words). LHT will also occasionally publish shorter research notes (under 4,000 words) on current work of excellent potential. Authors must make a request for reviewing of research notes, if required, in the cover letter.
